# MEVD

***This repository publicly shares certain tools used in the paper titled "Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection based on Multi-scale Encoders" along with the release of experimental data.***

## Evaluation

MEVD has been rigorously evaluated against existing  methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our evaluations,  benchmarked against these methods, reveal that MEVD demonstrates  superior performance across key metrics such as accuracy, precision,  recall, and F1-Score.

## Result:

Below is a visual representation showcasing a portion of the experimental data:
